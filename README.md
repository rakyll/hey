[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/hey.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/hey)

hey is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

hey was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's
tool at [tarekziade/boom](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom). Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases
where binary name conflicts created confusion.
To preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to hey.

## Installation

    go get -u github.com/rakyll/hey

## Usage

hey runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level and prints stats.

It also supports HTTP2 endpoints.

```
Usage: hey [options...] <url>

Options:
  -n  Number of requests to run. Default is 200.
  -c  Number of requests to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot
      be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is 50.
  -q  Rate limit, in queries per second (QPS). Default is no rate limit.
  -z  Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached,
      application stops and exits. If duration is specified, n is ignored.
      Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
  -o  Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.
      "csv" is the only supported alternative. Dumps the response
      metrics in comma-separated values format.

  -m  HTTP method, one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.

  -x  HTTP Proxy address as host:port.
  -h2 Enable HTTP/2.

  -host	HTTP Host header.

  -disable-keepalive    Disable keep-alive, prevents re-use of TCP
                        connections between different HTTP requests.
