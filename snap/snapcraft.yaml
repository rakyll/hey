description: |
  hey is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.
  hey was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's tool at
  tarekziade/boom. Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases
  where binary name conflicts created confusion. To preserve the name for its
  original owner, we renamed this project to hey.
